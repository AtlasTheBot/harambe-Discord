    "And, of course, once Harambe became a joke, his name was launched into the nonsense stratosphere in which all big memes orbit — the place where the word Harambe itself suffices for a punch line, without needing to mean much at all. Which has led us now to the current pervasive Harambe meme: dicks out for Harambe. Here is how (I think) it works: As a tribute to the primate, you get your dick out. Here is the actor Danny Trejo doing it. I’m not sure what that accomplishes, but… Thats that"
