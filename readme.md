#### What can Harambe do?

These are his commands! (Copy-pasted because I'm lazy)

```json
{
  "harambe": "Picture of me!\nChosen from hand-picked organic pictures",
  "gorilla": "*Gorilla sounds*.\nYou must be in a voice channel",
  "joke"   : "Cincinnati-Zoo approved jokes!\nUse ðŸ”« joke [joke number] to get a specific one!",
  "best"   : "Yes",
  "invite" : "Bring him home!\n*Do not let near children*",
  "info"   : "Who made this? Why?\nFind out with this command!",
  "stats"  : "See how much work Harambe needs to do!"
}
```

#### Wait how do I invoke him?

:gun: [command]

#### ...Really?

Yes, I'm serious.

`:gun:` [space] `[command]`

#### Why?

Someone asked me to do it, so I said "Why not?"

#### wait can you make a bot for me?

i dunno, probably. Depends on what kind of bot + the work needed. I probably won't host it though, but I can tell you how to do it.

#### I'm the Cincinnati-Zoo and I'm triggered.

pls no cease and desist harambe is a free gorilla


#### License

yeah I'm gonna put a license on a bot based off a gorilla that everyone turned into a meme.

The license is the one that you can reuse the code but you have to share it under a similar license and you can't use it and make money off it.

you know what I'm talking about

*that* license
